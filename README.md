# Sales-Forecasting 
Develop a data science project using historical sales data to build a regression model that accurately predicts future sales. Preprocess the dataset, conduct exploratory analysis, select relevant features, and employ regression algorithms for model development. Evaluate model performance, optimize hyperparameters, and provide actionable insights.
## Problem Statement:
The problem is to develop a sales forecasting regression model that can accurately predict future sales based on historical sales data. This will enable businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, resource allocation, and sales strategy.
## Solution Approach:
The solution approach involves utilizing machine learning techniques to analyze patterns and trends in the historical sales data. The dataset will be preprocessed to handle missing values and relevant features will be engineered. Regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests,Extra Trees or Gradient Boosting such as XGBoost, CatBoost, Light GBM will be employed to train the sales forecast model. The model's performance will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, and hyperparameter tuning will be conducted to optimize its accuracy.

## Findings :
Based on the regression model, it is found that certain product attributes, marketing natures, and pricing strategies have a significant impact on sales. The model accurately predicts future sales with a reasonable degree of accuracy, providing businesses with reliable forecasts for decision-making. The findings also highlight the importance of external factors in sales fluctuations, enabling businesses to adapt their strategies accordingly. Overall, the sales forecasting regression model proves to be a valuable tool for improving sales performance and optimizing business operations.
## Insights : 
The insights gained from the model and data analysis can provide valuable information for business decision-making. For example, the model can identify the most significant factors influencing sales performance and quantify their impact. It can also highlight the most effective marketing natures, optimal pricing strategies, and the potential impact of external factors on sales. These insights can help businesses allocate resources effectively, optimize inventory levels, outlet location and devise strategies to maximize sales.
